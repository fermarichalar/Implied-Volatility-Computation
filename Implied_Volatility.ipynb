    "## 1. Implied Volatility (IV)\n",
    "\n",
    "Implied volatility refers to the level of volatility that makes the Black–Scholes model price match the observed market price. It is called *implied* because it is inferred by inverting the pricing model rather than being directly observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Black–Scholes formula cannot be algebraically inverted to express volatility as a closed-form function of the option price. There is no explicit analytical formula for implied volatility.\n",

    "Implied volatility is computed using numerical root-finding methods. We define the target function:\n",
